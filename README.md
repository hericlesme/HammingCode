# Hamming Code Implementation


Hamming code implementation in Java language  
The code consists of detecting and correcting errors in a sequence of bits

If more error-correcting bits are included with a message, and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results, then bad bits could be identified. In a seven-bit message, there are seven possible single bit errors, so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error.
